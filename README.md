# Elecraft K2 IF Buffer Amplifier 

This is a reproduction of the Clifton Laboratories Z10000-K2 Buffer Amplifier,
designed by Jack R. Smith, K8ZOA (SK). The amplifier is also commercially
available from [DX Engineering](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/dxe-z10000k2-kit#overview).

The amplifier allows to tap the K2's 4.915 MHz IF and feed it into a SDR to
realize a band scope feature.

This project contains the full KiCad design data (schmematics, PCB) and will be
extended with additional information on building and integrating this amplifier
into the K2 eventually (work in progress).
